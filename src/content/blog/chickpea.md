#### **Option 1: Growing in a Garden**
1. **Loosen the soil** to a depth of **10-12 inches**.
2. Mix in **compost or aged manure** to enrich the soil.
3. Ensure **good drainage** to prevent root rot.

#### **Option 2: Growing in Containers**

  - Avoid disturbing roots while weeding.
- **Pest Control**:
  - Common pests: **Aphids, pod borers, cutworms**.
  - Use **neem oil spray** or **introduce ladybugs** as natural predators.

---

### **Step 6: Fertilization**
- Chickpeas **fix nitrogen** in the soil, so they require minimal fertilizer.
- If needed, apply **low-nitrogen organic fertilizer** (compost or bone meal).
- Too much nitrogen can lead to excessive leaf growth and fewer pods.

---

### **Step 7: Pollination**
- Chickpeas are **self-pollinating**, so manual intervention is not required.
- If growing indoors or in greenhouses, **shake plants gently** to assist pollination.

---

### **Step 8: Harvesting the Chickpeas**

### **Step 2: Drying the Beans**
- Spread harvested chickpeas in a **dry, sunny area** for **2-3 days**.

### **Step 3: Shelling the Chickpeas**
- Remove dried beans from pods by **pressing or rubbing them**.

### **Step 4: Storing the Chickpeas**
- Store in **an airtight container** in a cool, dry place.
- Keep away from moisture to prevent spoilage.

---

## **4. Tips for Successful Chickpea Farming**
- **Rotate crops** with cereals or vegetables to maintain soil health.
- **Avoid overwatering**, especially in humid conditions.
- **Protect young plants** from birds by using netting.
- **Harvest on a dry day** to prevent mold formation in stored beans.

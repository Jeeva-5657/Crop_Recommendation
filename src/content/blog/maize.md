---

### **Step 3: Preparing the Soil & Planting**
#### **Option 1: Growing in a Garden or Field**
1. **Loosen the soil** to a depth of **8-12 inches**.
2. Mix in **organic compost** or manure for better fertility.
3. Level the soil and create **rows spaced 24-30 inches apart**.

#### **Option 2: Growing in Containers**

- Space seeds **8-12 inches apart** within rows.
- Water the soil **gently but thoroughly** after planting.

---

### **Step 4: Watering & Maintenance**
- Water regularly to keep soil **evenly moist**.
- Reduce watering as plants mature to prevent fungal infections.

- Use **organic compost or cow manure** for natural nutrients.
- Side-dress with fertilizer when plants are **knee-high and during flowering**.

---

### **Step 7: Pollination**
- Maize is **wind-pollinated**, so plant in **blocks rather than single rows** for better pollination.
- **Shake the stalks** gently during flowering to help distribute pollen.

---

### **Step 8: Harvesting the Maize**

- Harvest when the **silk turns brown**, but husks remain green.
- Check by pressing a kernel: if **milky juice comes out**, it's ready.
- For **field or popcorn maize**, wait until **husks dry out completely**.

---

## **3. Processing the Harvested Maize**
### **Step 1: Husk Removal**
- Peel off the husks **by hand** after harvesting.

### **Step 2: Drying the Corn (for storage)**
- If storing as **grain**, let the cobs dry in the sun for **2-3 weeks**.

### **Step 3: Shelling the Kernels**
- Remove dried kernels **by rubbing the cob** or using a shelling tool.

### **Step 4: Storing the Maize**
- Store dry kernels in **airtight containers** in a cool, dry place.
- For fresh sweet corn, **refrigerate** and use within a few days.

## **4. Tips for Successful Maize Farming**
- **Rotate maize crops** with legumes to improve soil fertility.
- **Avoid overcrowding** to ensure proper pollination.
- **Protect young plants** from birds and rodents by covering with nets.

## **5. FAQs**
### **Q: Can I grow maize indoors?**
- No, maize requires **full sunlight and open air** for proper growth.

### **Q: How much maize can I harvest per plant?**

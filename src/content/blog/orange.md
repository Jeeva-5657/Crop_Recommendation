### **Step 3: Planting Orange Trees**  

#### **In the Garden**  
1. **Best time to plant**: Spring or early summer.  
2. **Spacing**:  
   - **Standard trees**: 12-15 feet apart.  
   - **Dwarf trees**: 6-8 feet apart.  
3. **Dig a hole**: Twice as wide as the root ball.  
4. **Plant at the same depth** as in the nursery pot.  
5. **Mulch around the base** to retain moisture and suppress weeds.  

#### **In Containers**  
- Use a **large container (15-25 gallons)** with drainage holes.  
- Choose **dwarf orange varieties** like Calamondin or Clementine.  
- Provide **support with a stake** to prevent leaning.  

---

### **Step 4: Watering & Mulching**  
- **Young trees**: Deep watering once a week.  
- **Mature trees**: Water **every 10-15 days**, depending on climate.  
- Apply **mulch** (wood chips, straw, or compost) around the base to retain moisture.  

---

### **Step 5: Fertilization**  
- **First year**: Use a **mild fertilizer** to encourage root growth.  
- **Second year onwards**:  
  - Use **citrus fertilizer (2:1:1 NPK ratio)** every 3 months.  
  - Add **Epsom salt** (magnesium) to prevent yellowing leaves.  
  - Apply **organic compost** before flowering.  

---

### **Step 6: Pollination**  
- Most orange trees are **self-pollinating**, but having multiple trees **increases yield**.  
- Attract pollinators (bees, butterflies) by planting flowers nearby.  

---

### **Step 8: Pruning & Training**  
- **Prune in late winter or early spring** to remove dead/diseased branches.  
- Train young trees to develop **a strong central trunk**.  
- Avoid excessive pruning, as it reduces fruit production.  

---

### **Step 9: Harvesting Oranges**
